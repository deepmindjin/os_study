## Context Switching
Basically, CPU works only with registers. It just follows codes line by line. By 
chaning PC(Program Conter) resgister, we can jump to other code section. 
To excute other function (in a broad way, other thread or programs), current values in registers 
have to be stored somewhere. For example, lr(link register) is register for storing address to 
go back when current function ends. So everytime code enters another fuction and needs to be returned
 in current position, current address should be stored in lr. However, if you get into nested fuction
, lr would be rewrited and previous position is deleted. So there should be some way to store some 
information. and saving thoes values is called **Context Swtiching**. There could be a lot of 
information, so usually Context Switching uses STACK memory.

```
str	lr, [sp, #-4]!

	...
	...

ldr	pc, [sp]. #4
```
This shows how to store lr(link register) in stack. It's just simple code only storing lr, but 
basic concept could be applied in other context switching situations.
